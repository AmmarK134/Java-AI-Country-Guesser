# Java-AI-Country-Guesser
Introducing the Java AI Country Guesser Game!

Welcome to the Java AI Country Guesser Game, where you can test your knowledge of countries in a fun and interactive way. This game is designed to engage users in a guessing game where the program prompts a series of questions, and based on the user's responses, attempts to deduce the country they are thinking of. If the program fails to guess the country, it graciously asks the user to provide the correct answer, enriching its database for future games.

How it Works:
Interactive Gameplay: Users are presented with a series of questions about the characteristics of the country they have in mind. They respond with "yes" or "no" to each question.

AI Guessing Algorithm: Based on the user's responses, the program employs an AI algorithm to narrow down the possibilities and make an educated guess about the country.

Continuous Learning: In case the program fails to guess correctly, it prompts the user to reveal the country they were thinking of. The user's input is then stored in the program's database, enhancing its knowledge for future games.

Features:
Engaging and intuitive user interface.
Dynamic questioning based on user input.
Adaptive AI algorithm for intelligent guessing.
Database integration for continuous learning and improvement.
